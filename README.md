# User Retention Curve
This application shows up a retention curve chart based on the series data coming from the Temper Onboarding flow user retention. 
- Each line represents a weekly cohort.
- The X-axis represents the boarding step of the flow.
- The Y-axis represents the percentage of the users retained in that step.
